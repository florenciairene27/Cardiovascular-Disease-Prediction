## Projects
### CardioSAS: Predictive Modeling for Cardiovascular Disease Risk Assessment 
**Description**: Developed a SAS-based predictive model using electronic medical records for cardiovascular disease risk assessment. Conducted extensive exploratory data analysis, delineating crucial disparities in BMI, weight, and cholesterol levels between heart disease and non-disease groups. Utilized statistical methods (t-tests, chi-square tests, logistic regression) to refine the model, achieving 72.30% accuracy by addressing variable issues. Identified pivotal predictors for heart disease risk, highlighting the significance of nuanced model evaluation beyond accuracy.
